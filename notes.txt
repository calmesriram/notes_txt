github hosting in angular 
ðŸŒ¹  git checkout -b gh-pages
ðŸŒ¹  git push origin gh-pages
ðŸŒ¹  npm install -g angular-cli-ghpages

(or)

To deploy Angular application first create a repository on GitHub. To do that navigate to https://github.com/  and click on New Repository.  I am creating a repository named  â€œdemo9â€œ.  

 After the repository is created, use git command to add this repository as remote to the local project. For that run command as below :

git remote add origin https://github.com/USERNAME/PROJECT_NAME.git

Do not forget to change username and project name. Once the remote repository is added, you can verify that using the command

git remote -v

As output, you should get repository listed as below:

 

Step 5
To deploy the Angular application to GitHub, you need to first install the angular-cli-ghpages globally:

 npm install -g angular-cli-ghpages

 After installing that ghpages, use Angular CLI to build the project. For that run command as shown below:

ng build --prod --base-href https://debugmodedotnet.github.io/demo9/

Make sure that you are using your GitHub username and repository name.  After successful execution of the command, you should get bundle.js created as shown in the image below: 

 

As the last step, run command ngh â€“no-silent to publish the application as shown in the image below:

 

After successful publish navigate to  https://<username>.github.io/<reponame>/ to navigate to the application.  This is all you need to do to deploy the Angular application to GitHub.
